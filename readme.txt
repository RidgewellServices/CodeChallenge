I used:
- git, Node, NPM
- heroku for a host. The link is: https://c-s-challenge.herokuapp.com/
- qunit to test. Open test.html in a browser to see the tests run. They live in tests/test.js.
- express and forever to facilitate display of the webpage.

I originally deployed to my public git repository, RidgewellServices/CodeChallenge, but git is down, so I couldn't finish the project there. I switched to heroku's git, which is pretty private. I'll try to update my public git repository when they're back up so you can see the history. In the meantime, I'll include a .zip of the code.

I had never used heroku before, so that was very cool to learn about. I tried to keep the html very simple--just enough to support the challenge results.
